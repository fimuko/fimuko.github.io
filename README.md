just a blog
- posts written with markdown for simplicity and speed
- hosting: github pages
- posts in _posts, the rest of the files is for static website generation
- styling: github pages compatible jekyll theme ([cayman blog](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog#hosting-with-github-pages)), slightly [customized](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes) through editing `./_sass/variables.scss`
